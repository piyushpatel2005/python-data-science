When solving a business problem, you may need many machine learning models. Avoid trap of creating single monolithic ML model for a large problem. Break down the problem into smaller chunks and create machine learning model for each of them. For example, a product of reading an image through camera and translating that into different languages might need following models.
1. Model to read Images
2. OCR character recognition
3. Identify the language in the photo
4. Translate the sign
5. Superimpose the translated text
